# hello-world
This is my first step on the new land


the tutorial asks me to write something about myself and I don't know what I should do.

However, I strongly feel that maybe I should say that I am not a computer geek and I chose to do what I am doing right now is to survive. However, CS is not that kind of troublesome for me and my IQ is high enough to do it well.
